# mpc-tss-js

**WARNING: Work in progress!**

An attempt to implement a multi-party computation (MPC) threshold signature scheme (TSS) in Javascript/Typescript for use on Node.js, browsers, react-native apps and other modern JS platforms. This strives to be secure and auditable, based on state of the art research and proven implementations, MIT-licensed.

Current status: some playing around with architecture and sources of inspiration.

TODO (to be expanded):
* [ ] Create a proper readme
* [ ] Lay out the goals and the plan
* [ ] Do it :)
